# Markov Processes and Information Theory: A Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Introduction to Markov Processes

### What is a Markov Process?
A Markov process is a mathematical system where the future state depends only on the present state, not on past states. Think of it like predicting tomorrow's weather - in a Markov process, you only need to know today's weather, not what happened last week.

### Basic Components
1. **States**: The possible conditions of the system
   - Example: Weather states (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy)
   - In our notes: States A and B

2. **Transitions**: How the system moves between states
   - Represented by probabilities
   - Example: 70% chance of staying sunny if it's sunny today

### Mathematical Representation
1. **State Diagrams**:
   ```
   A ←→ B
   ↺   ↺
   ```
   - Arrows show possible transitions
   - Numbers on arrows show probabilities

2. **Transition Equations**:
   From the chalkboard:
   $$f_A(t+1) = 0.7f_A(t) + 0.4f_B(t)$$
   $$f_B(t+1) = 0.3f_A(t) + 0.6f_B(t)$$

   What this means:
   - $$f_A(t)$$ is the probability of being in state A at time t
   - 0.7 is the probability of staying in state A
   - 0.4 is the probability of moving from B to A

3. **Transition Matrix**:
   $$M = \begin{pmatrix} 0.7 & 0.4 \\ 0.3 & 0.6 \end{pmatrix}$$
   
   Reading the matrix:
   - First row: transitions from A
   - Second row: transitions from B
   - Each column must sum to 1

## 2. Population Systems (N-Systems)

### Understanding Population Distributions
1. **Total Population (N)**:
   - Fixed total: $$N = N_A + N_B$$
   - $$N_A$$: number in state A
   - $$N_B$$: number in state B

2. **Population Fractions**:
   $$f_A = \frac{N_A}{N}$$ (fraction in state A)
   $$f_B = \frac{N_B}{N}$$ (fraction in state B)

3. **Conservation Laws**:
   - $$f_A + f_B = 1$$ (fractions sum to 1)
   - This is crucial for checking your work!

### Example:
In a population of 1000 people:
- If 600 are in state A: $$f_A = \frac{600}{1000} = 0.6$$
- Then 400 must be in state B: $$f_B = \frac{400}{1000} = 0.4$$

## 3. Steady State Analysis

### What is a Steady State?
A steady state occurs when the system stabilizes and probabilities stop changing.

### Finding Steady States
1. **Set up equations**:
   $$f_A = 0.7f_A + 0.4f_B$$ (from state A equation)
   $$f_A + f_B = 1$$ (conservation law)

2. **Solve step by step**:
   - Rearrange first equation:
     $$0.3f_A = 0.4f_B$$
     $$f_A = \frac{4}{3}f_B$$
   - Substitute into conservation law:
     $$\frac{4}{3}f_B + f_B = 1$$
     $$\frac{7}{3}f_B = 1$$
     $$f_B = \frac{3}{7}$$
   - Therefore:
     $$f_A = \frac{4}{7}$$

3. **Verify solution**:
   - Check probabilities sum to 1
   - Check transition equations are satisfied

## 4. Information Theory Fundamentals

### Mutual Information
1. **Basic Definition**:
   $$H(X:Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)$$
   
   Where:
   - $$H(X)$$ is entropy of X
   - $$H(X|Y)$$ is conditional entropy

2. **Properties**:
   - Always non-negative
   - Symmetric: $$H(X:Y) = H(Y:X)$$
   - Zero if X and Y are independent

### Data Processing Inequality
1. **The Chain**: X → Y → Z

2. **The Inequality**:
   $$H(X:Z) \leq H(X:Y)$$

3. **What it means**:
   - Information can only decrease through processing
   - You can't gain information by processing existing data

### Proof of Data Processing Inequality
1. Start with Markov property:
   $$H(X:Z|Y) = 0$$

2. Use chain rule:
   $$H(X:Y,Z) = H(X:Y) + H(X:Z|Y)$$

3. Therefore:
   $$H(X:Z) \leq H(X:Y,Z) = H(X:Y)$$

## 5. Practical Applications

### 1. Weather Prediction
- States: Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy
- Use transition probabilities from historical data
- Calculate likely weather patterns

### 2. Gene Expression
- States: Active, Inactive
- Model protein production
- Predict steady-state concentrations

### 3. Communication Systems
- Apply data processing inequality
- Optimize information transmission
- Minimize information loss

## 6. Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

1. **Transition Probabilities**
   - Must sum to 1 for each state
   - Cannot be negative
   - Double-check your matrix rows

2. **Steady State Calculations**
   - Always verify your solution
   - Check conservation laws
   - Ensure probabilities are between 0 and 1

3. **Information Theory**
   - Remember H(X:Y) ≥ 0
   - Check Markov chain conditions
   - Verify inequality directions

## 7. Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Transition Matrix
Given matrix:
$$M = \begin{pmatrix} 0.6 & 0.2 \\ 0.4 & 0.8 \end{pmatrix}$$

### Problem 2: Information Theory
For Markov chain X → Y → Z, prove that:
$$H(X:Z) \leq \min(H(X:Y), H(Y:Z))$$
